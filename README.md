# 2D Side Scroller

## Overview
This is a project developed in Unity 2019.2.6 which is used to demonstrate some of my programming skills and designed to be played one-handed.

Tap the screen in order to jump, avoid the obstacles, and collect as many coins as possible

## Features
- Procedurally generated level, which means that the order of every segment (apart from the first one encountered) is randomised
- Instruction Menu and Gameover Screen
- Randomly placed coins and obstacles, which alters the gameplay on each playthrough
